# Project Title

FRE7773 - Final Project - Kaggle: Optiver Volatility Prediction

## Description

Volatility describes fluctuations in prices of securities in the financial markets. It is of great importance for both individual and institutional investors, for giving them guidance on different securities' risk characteristics, thus helping them make judicious and appropriate investing decisions based on their unique risk preferences. In our Machine Learning project, we built models to predict 112 stocks' realized volatility over a 10-minute time window across different market sectors.
